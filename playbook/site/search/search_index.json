For example, you may have a chatbot explaining the different healthcare financing schemes to the public. In this case, you would want to ensure that the chatbot does not generate harmful nor inappropriate content such as medical advice.</p> <p>At GovTech, we use the term guardrails to refer specifically to separate components from the LLM itself that can filter or even adjust harmful or undesired content before it is generated by the LLM or returned to the user. The diagram below best illustrates how guardrails work in an AI system. As shown, prompts first pass through an input guardrail before being sent to the LLM. Correspondingly, the output from the LLM is then passed through an output guardrail before being returned to the user. While LLMs likely have some built-in safety mechanisms baked in through their training process, or API providers may have their own guardrails when they process the prompts we provide, we find it useful to have guardrails that build upon these for both performance and flexibility reasons that we will articulate below.</p> <p> Figure 1: High-level overview of guardrails in an AI system</p> <p>Guardrails can be as simple as a keyword check. For example, does the input or output contain any keywords defined in a blacklist of terms (e.g., common profanities or disallowed topics)? However, such an approach may not always be effective and does not leverage upon the predictive capabilities of machine learning models. Thus, more modern implementations would likely incorporate some machine learning, in order to capture the semantics of the statement. Additionally, these guardrails are also multi-layered, ensuring overall robustness.</p> <p>Tip: Guardrails as a Machine Learning Classification Task</p> <p>For those with a Machine Learning background, guardrails can be thought of as a binary classification task: Is the content acceptable or not? Hence, typical classification metrics such as precision, recall, Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve (ROC-AUC), F1-score, etc. can be used to evaluate the performance of the guardrail. More details on these metrics can be found here.</p> <p>Here are some common types of risks you might want guardrails for in your AI system:</p> Type Description Input Output Toxicity/Content Moderation Harmful, offensive, or inappropriate content \u2713 \u2713 Jailbreak/Prompt Injection Attempts to bypass system constraints or inject malicious prompts \u2713 PII Information that can identify an individual \u2713 \u2713 Off-Topic Content irrelevant to the application's purpose \u2713 \u2713 System-Prompt Leakage Exposure of system prompts containing application information \u2713 Hallucination Content not factual or grounded in source material \u2713 Relevance Responses not pertinent to user queries \u2713 <p>We elaborate more on each of these guardrails in our next chapter.</p>"},{"location":"guardrails/#principles-for-effective-guardrails","title":"Principles for Effective Guardrails \ud83c\udfaf","text":"<p>In our last year of work on guardrails, we have identified three principles that are crucial for effective guardrails.</p>"},{"location":"guardrails/#1-performant-localised-and-fast","title":"1. Performant, Localised, and Fast \ud83d\ude80","text":"<p>Firstly, guardrails should be performant, localised, and fast - and each builds upon the previous. Having performant guardrails means one can correctly identify unwanted content. However, there is an inherent trade-off between false positives and false negatives, or what we call the \"precision vs recall\" trade-off in machine learning parlance. If the guardrail is too strict, it may wrongly flag more harmless content, while if it is too lenient, it may wrongly flag more harmful content.</p> <p>Performance improves with a multi-layered approach. For example, while an individual guardrail may not be able to identify harmful content, a combination of guardrails is likely to do so. This is also known as the \"Swiss cheese model\", where each guardrail is like a slice of cheese, and the holes in the cheese represent the weaknesses in each guardrail. Each guardrail will complement the others, and together they form a robust system. </p> <p> Figure 2: The Swiss cheese model of guardrails</p> <p>Tip: Balancing Between Precision and Recall</p> <p>If your system can accommodate different guardrails, you may want to consider prioritising precision over recall for each individual guardrail. And by stacking different guardrails, you could potentially increase the overall recall of the system.</p> <p>Performance also typically requires localisation. One obvious example is language and culture - a content moderation guardrail trained based on the internet may not precisely classify the nuances of terms used in Singapore. Beyond that, there is also localisation to the business context. For example, a specific acronym or terminology that is common in one industry may not be used in another. There is thus also a trade-off here between being universal and localised. </p> <p>Case Study: LionGuard \ud83e\udd81 - a localised content moderation guardrail</p> <p>LionGuard is a content moderation guardrail that is localised to the Singapore context. You can read more about it here and try it out here.</p> <p>There is then the last trade-off between accuracy and latency. Guardrails should operate efficiently without introducing significant latency, ensuring real-time feedback and a smooth user experience. Being performant also means that the guardrails can accurately identify harmful content.</p>"},{"location":"guardrails/#2-model-agnostic-design","title":"2. Model-Agnostic Design \ud83e\udde9","text":"<p>As defined above, we treat Guardrails as separate components from the LLM itself. By doing so, we can develop and test the different components independently. This also offers us the flexibility to swap out different guardrails and LLMs, depending on the scenario. </p> <p>Extra: Alignment and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)</p> <p>The task of ensuring that models are safe typically falls within the problem space called \"Model Alignment\". For models that power applications like ChatGPT, Alignment is typically achieved through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). We will not delve into the details of RLHF here, but it is a very active area of research and development in the LLM space. See here for more details.</p> <p>Having the guardrail as a separate component also allows us to determine the minimum safety performance of our system. Typical implementations of guardrails tend to be more deterministic compared to the variability of LLM outputs. Hence, if a guardrail has 95% accuracy in detecting not suitable for work (NSFW) language, then the entire system\u2019s safety level is also at least 95%, leaving the model to deal with the remainder. Moreover, the underlying LLM or API provider may also change their own implementations. Hence, having separate guardrails provides us with more certainty on the holistic performance of the system.</p>"},{"location":"guardrails/#3-actionable-and-configurable","title":"3. Actionable and configurable \ud83d\udd27","text":"<p>Being actionable means that the product team can take more differentiated actions based on the guardrail's confidence or severity scores. If there was only a binary response, the application can then only take two possible courses of action. Conversely, if the guardrail provides a 0-1 confidence or severity score, the product team can then take more differentiated actions. For example, if the score was between 0 to 0.33, the application could choose to log the content; if the score was between 0.34 to 0.66, the application could choose to warn the user; and if the score was between 0.67 to 1, the application could choose to block the content.</p> <p>Extra: Confidence and Severity Scores</p> <p>Confidence refers to how certain the guardrail is about its classification. Here we loosely interchange it with the term \"probability\" too. On the other hand, severity refers to the degree of harmfulness of the content. Guardrail providers typically provide one of the two.</p> <p>For confidence, it is important for these scores to be calibrated. A well-calibrated confidence score should have the property that, if the guardrail predicts that there is a 50% chance that the content is harmful, then in fact, 50% of the time, the content is harmful. </p> <p>When we use most machine learning models out of the box, the probability scores are not well-calibrated. See here for further details on calibration.</p> <p>Being configurable means that the product team can adjust the guardrail's parameters to meet the needs of the application. For example, the product team may want to adjust the threshold for the confidence or severity scores. Balancing precision (accurately identifying harmful content) and recall (capturing all instances of harmful content) is crucial; this balance should be adjusted according to the application's context\u2014for example, prioritizing recall in healthcare settings where safety is paramount, or emphasizing precision in customer service to enhance user experience.</p> <p>Original Blog Post</p> <p>This page is adapted from our original blog post on this topic.</p>"},{"location":"resources/","title":"Resources","text":"<p>In this page, we share some seminal, influential and innovative works that have made waves in the RAI space, as well as a short tldr on their impact and/or potential applications. </p>"},{"location":"resources/#surveys","title":"Surveys","text":"<ul> <li>Open Problems and Fundamental Limitations of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (Jul 2023) </li> <li>Siren\u2019s Song in the AI Ocean: A Survey on Hallucination in Large Language Models (Sep 2023)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"resources/#benchmarks","title":"Benchmarks","text":"<ul> <li>Holistic Evaluation of Language Models -

However, users exploited the chatbot's lack of safeguards, prompting it to agree to absurd deals, such as selling a 2024 Chevy Tahoe for $1. Similarly, a Bloomberg investigation revealed that OpenAI's GPT-4 model exhibited racial biases when ranking resumes. The LLM favored names associated with Asian women and ranked those linked to Black men lowest for certain job roles. </p> <p>In another example, Air Canada's LLM chatbot provided a customer with incorrect information regarding bereavement fares, which led to the customer's claim being denied by Air Canada on the basis that the chatbot's information was non-binding.

If unsafe or biased data is used for training, the model outputs are likely to be unsafe and biased as well. For example, \u200ba 2019 study revealed that a widely used healthcare algorithm exhibited racial bias by underestimating the health needs of black patients compared to equally ill white patients. The algorithm used healthcare costs as a proxy for health needs, leading to black patients, who typically incur lower healthcare costs due to systemic disparities, being assigned lower risk scores. Consequently, black patients were less likely to be referred for advanced care management programs.</p> <p>In the Generative AI space, LLMs are typically pre-trained on massive amounts of text or image data from the Internet, which contain harmful, toxic and biased texts. Since LLMs autoregressively generate the next most probable token, the output depends on the joint distribution of tokens learned during training. If unsafe token sequences are learned, they will naturally be reproduced by the model, as ChatGPT did in its early days.

One key consideration is whether to include sensitive variables (i.e. variables about protected attributes like race or gender) in the model. On one hand, including these variables may result in bias against specific groups, such as ageist and sexist bias in online recruitment software. However, algorithmic bias has also been shown to persist even in models that deliberately exclude sensitive variables from the model, such as with recidivism prediction (i.e. COMPAS) or with delivery services (i.e. Amazon Prime).</p> <p>In the generative AI space, significant research has been dedicated to aligning models with human preferences and desirable values.

Hallucination and factuality","text":"<p>Ensuring LLM outputs are grounded in facts and the provided context improves reliability. Techniques include:</p> <ul> <li>Comparing responses against a reference (likely retrieved)</li> <li>Knowledge graph validation</li> <li>Citation checking</li> </ul> <p>Of the above, the first technique is most popular, particularly in the RAG setting. There are currently many tools available for doing so (see GovTech AIP's RAG Playbook for an assessment), including:</p> <ul> <li>RAGAS</li> <li>TruLens</li> <li>DeepEval</li> <li>AWS Bedrock Guardrails Contextual Grounding</li> <li>Azure AI Content Safety Groundedness</li> </ul> <p>There is also a parallel track of research generally known as reference-free hallucination detection, which does not require a reference or source to verify claims. This is based on the intuition that LLMs may exhibit tell-tale behaviours when hallucinating, much like humans sweating when lying. There are three main approaches:</p> Approach Description Examples Sampling-based Prompting the LLM to respond multiple times and evaluating the consistency of the responses; however, this can be computationally costly - Self-evaluation  - SelfCheckGPT  - Semantic-aware cross-check consistency (SAC<sup>3</sup>)  - Cross-examination  - CleanLab Probability-based Examining and aggregating the probabilities of tokens generated, reframing hallucination detection as uncertainty estimation; however, this requires access to token probabilities, which close APIs do not provide - Token probability  - Claim Conditioned Probability  - Semantic Entropy  - LM-Polygraph Model-based Finetuning new models to detect hallucination - Lynx <p>Latency and cost</p> <p>When using these evaluators at inference time, latency and cost may be of concern, especially when the response is long and has to be broken down into multiple claims/statements. Most methods rely on multiple calls to an evaluator LLM, compounding latency. An alternative method is to use light weight natural language inference (NLI) models to detect entailment. Another option is to simply provide citations, allowing end-users to perform reference and fact verification on their own. </p> <p>While closely related to hallucination, factuality refers to the accuracy of information presented in accordance to world knowledge. World knowledge can be obtained from external tools like Wikipedia or Google Search, or stored in a knowledge base that serves as a single source of truth. Verifying responses with respect to world knowledge then becomes similar to hallucination detection in the RAG setting, with this world knowledge akin to the retrieved context. </p> <p>In practice, facts can exist in multiple external knowledge bases. Hence, many tools have emerged to create pipelines for fact checking and verification. This includes: </p> <ul> <li>Loki - end-to-end pipeline for dissecting long texts into individual claims, assessing their worthiness for verification, generating queries for evidence search, crawling for evidence, and verifying the claims; optimised with parallelism and human-in-the-loop</li> <li>Search-Augmented Factuality Evaluator (SAFE) - use LLM agents to reason and send search queries to Google Search</li> <li>Grounding with Gemini - ground Gemini responses with Google Search</li> </ul> <p>Tip: Prompt Design</p> <p>Beyond having a separate guardrail model, it is prudent to design your prompt to minimise hallucination. This includes:</p> <ul> <li>Charater role prompting</li> <li>Chain of Thought/Chain of Knowledge</li> <li>Instructing the model to respond \"I don't know\" if it is not certain</li> <li>Opinion-based prompts</li> <li>Counterfactual demonstrations</li> </ul> <p>Tip: Decoding</p> <p>Given access to model weights, it is also possible to improve decoding strategies to reduce hallucinations.
