# Sentinel: Robust AI Guardrails for Government AI Systems

Sentinel provides a multi-tenant SaaS service that allows development teams building Generative AI applications to integrate Input and Output Guardrails for AI security and safety. These guardrails detect, quantify, and mitigate risks like prompt injection, toxicity, and PII leakage. By providing the ability to integrate guardrails within any GenAI application, Sentinel provides application teams with the assurance that their application is safeguarded from basic risks present in all generative-AI models.

For optimal performance, Sentinel is recommended to be used in conjunction with Litmus (WOG AI Testing product), to ensure application teams are mitigating against the specific risks identified in their individual models and/or applications.


## Why Use Sentinel?

Sentinel provides essential protection for Government Generative AI applications with:

- Input and Output Guardrails tailored towards sensitive government data
- Detection and quantification of AI risks in public sector contexts
- Mitigation of common AI vulnerabilities in government systems
- Curation of both best-in-class and in-house created guardrails to comprehensively protect government applications

Sentinel acts as the first line of defence, shielding Singapore's government AI applications from fundamental risks inherent in all generative AI models, ensuring the protection of citizen data and maintaining public trust.


## How Does Sentinel Work?
The following diagram shows how Sentinel enhances the safety and security of an AI App with both input and output guardrails:

## LionGuard Harm Categories

The table below lists the risk categories used by LionGuard. The model assigns a risk core to each category. Some categories are further classified into severity levels (Level 1 and Level 2) with Level 2 indicating a higher level of severity than Level 1. If a Level 2 instance is detected, Level 1 is also flagged by design.
