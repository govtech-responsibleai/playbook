Sentinel is GovTech's internal guardrail API service that provides a comprehensive suite of input and output guardrails for AI applications. It offers protection against risks like toxicity, prompt injection, PII exposure, and hallucination.

Sentinel is designed to be:

- Fast and performant with minimal latency impact
- Model-agnostic and compatible with any LLM
- Highly configurable with adjustable confidence thresholds
- Easy to integrate via REST API
