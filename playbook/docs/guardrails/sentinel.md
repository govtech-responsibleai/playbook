# Sentinel: Robust AI Guardrails for Government AI Systems

Sentinel provides a multi-tenant SaaS service that allows development teams building Generative AI applications to integrate Input and Output Guardrails for AI security and safety. These guardrails detect, quantify, and mitigate risks like prompt injection, toxicity, and PII leakage. By providing the ability to integrate guardrails within any GenAI application, Sentinel provides application teams with the assurance that their application is safeguarded from basic risks present in all generative-AI models.

For optimal performance, Sentinel is recommended to be used in conjunction with Litmus (WOG AI Testing product), to ensure application teams are mitigating against the specific risks identified in their individual models and/or applications.


### Why Use Sentinel?

Sentinel provides essential protection for Government Generative AI applications with:

- Input and Output Guardrails tailored towards sensitive government data
- Detection and quantification of AI risks in public sector contexts
- Mitigation of common AI vulnerabilities in government systems
- Curation of both best-in-class and in-house created guardrails to comprehensively protect government applications

Sentinel acts as the first line of defence, shielding Singapore's government AI applications from fundamental risks inherent in all generative AI models, ensuring the protection of citizen data and maintaining public trust.

## LionGuard Harm Categories

In the table below, we list the categories that LionGuard uses. The model provides a risk score for each risk category.

| S/N | Category | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Hateful | Content that expresses, incites, or promotes hate based on race, gender, ethnicity, religion, nationality, sexual orientation, disability status, or caste. Hateful content aimed at non-protected groups is considered harassment. Content that includes violence or serious harm towards protected groups. |
| 2 | Harassment | Content that expresses, incites, or promotes harassing language towards any target/individual. Content that causes prolonged mental or emotional suffering (>1 hour) without mention of violence. Any harassment content that includes violence or serious harm. |
| 3 | Encouraging Public Harm | Content that promotes, facilitates, or encourages harmful public acts, vice or organized crime. |
| 4 | Encouraging Self-Harm | Content that promotes, encourages, or depicts acts of self-harm, such as suicide, cutting, and eating disorders. Content that provides instructions or advice on committing such acts. |
