# LionGuard

LionGuard is a multilingual moderation system designed specifically for Singapore's unique linguistic and cultural context, addressing limitations in localisation and contextualisation faced by standard moderation guardrails.

Our latest version, LionGuard 2, enhances moderation capabilities through:
1. Support for English, Singlish, Chinese, Malay, and partial Tamil.
2. Integration of our Whole-of-Government [safety taxonomy](../testing/safety_testing/taxonomy.md), enabling fine-grained moderation with defined severity levels.
3. Improved robustness against noisy and code-mixed inputs.

Lightweight deployment remains central to LionGuardâ€™s design. LionGuard 2 utilises pre-trained OpenAI embeddings combined with a multi-head ordinal classifier, significantly outperforming commercial and open-source systems across 17 localised and general benchmarks. Importantly, LionGuard 2 achieves these accuracy improvements using a training dataset 70% smaller than its predecessor, LionGuard 1, and can be fully retrained within two minutes on standard CPUs.

To foster wider adoption and further research, LionGuard 2 is open-sourced for self-hosting and also accessible via the Sentinel API. Detailed insights are available in our [blog post](PLACEHOLDER) and [paper](PLACEHOLDER).
