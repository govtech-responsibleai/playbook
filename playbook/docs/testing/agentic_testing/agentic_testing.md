# Agentic Testing 

Testing agentic systems is significantly more onerous due to the need to test different components within the system. We developed the **Agentic Risk & Capability Framework** help organisations and developers systematically identify and manage the safety and security risks of agentic AI systems. 

!!! note "Agentic Risk & Capability Framework"

    The [Agentic Risk and Capability Framework](http://go.gov.sg/agentic-risk-capability) defines (i) baseline risks (i.e., risks that apply to all agentic systems), and (ii) a hierarchical taxonomy of capability risks (i.e., risks related to specific capabilities that particular systems may have). Each risk can then be systematically tested and evaluated. The framework also provides a mapping of each risk to a set of technical controls, as well as an example implementation of the framework. 

## How to perform testing?

    We are currently in the process of developing a testing framework. Please check back soon!
